# Project Generation Prompt

Create a simple web-based time picker with endless scrolling wheels for hours (0–23) and minutes (0–59).  
The wheels should support both touch gestures and arrow button clicks for selection, with animated transitions and a click sound effect on change.  
Use only vanilla JavaScript and CSS, no dependencies.  
The UI should be responsive and visually appealing, similar to the iOS Alarm app but with endless wheels.  
Include separate files for HTML, CSS, hour wheel logic, minute wheel logic, utility functions, sound effect, and touch gesture support.  
Provide a README describing features, usage, file structure, and customization options.

**Inspiration:**  
This project was inspired (and amused) by the hour wheel in the iOS Alarm app, which is not endless but amusingly stops somewhere
